## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Hey I'm ZAKARIA! I am a research scientist on and also currently lead OpenAI's Multi-Agent Team. I am interested in environments that allow for unbounded learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and generalization to unseen environments (e.g. simulation to reality). So far I've worked on unsupervised multi-agent reinforcement learning, state estimation from vision, attention based network architectures for reinforcement learning, and most recently emergence from multi-agent autocurricula. I have an M.Eng. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a focus in AI from MIT, and also a B.S. in EECS and Physics from MIT. During my masters I worked on neural network architecture search, a subfield at the intersection of meta-modeling and hyperparameter optimization.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/zachary2005/RGUIBI.github.oi/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
